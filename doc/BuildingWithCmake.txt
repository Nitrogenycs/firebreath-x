Building firebreath-x with CMake
================================

All files are specified relative to firebreath-x root folder.


Preparation
-----------

 - For command line cmake:  copy cmake.conf.stub to cmake.conf and edit settings
   CMake GUI provides file dialog based editors
   
 - Create a Firebreath project (see FireBreath documentation)
 
 - Move project folder 'projects'


Python plugin
-------------
 
 - Add following line to 'projects/<plugin-name>/CmakeLists.txt':
		
		target_link_libraries(${PLUGIN_NAME} fb_py)

 - Create a folder for build (out-of-source build), e.g., 'build_win32_vc9'
 
 - Start command shell and go into build directory
 
 - Make sure you have cmake in PATH
 
 - Run
 
		cmake -C ../cmake.conf ..
		
	This will create build projects for the default project generator determined by cmake. You can control this using '-G <generator>' (see cmake --help).
	
 - Open firebreath-x project file (e.g. 'build_win32_vc9/firebreath-x.sln').
 
 NOTE: Firebreath is also driven by cmake. This means that project configuration files are generated. 
	   If you change project settings, e.g., setting pre-processor definitions or adding source files, from within your IDE (e.g. Visual Studio)
	   they will be lost after next clean cmake run.
	   Instead, you have to change 'projects/<project-name>/CMakeLists.txt'
